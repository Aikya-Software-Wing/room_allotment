<h3>About Aikya Software Wing</h3>
<p>The Aikya Software Wing is the official software society of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, RNSIT. Since its inception, the wing has grown exponentially in size and enthusiasm. The members of the wing work to develop end to end solutions for complex problems that are faced on a day to day basis at the RN Shetty Group of Institutions and The Karnataka State Fire and Emergency Services, Government of Karnataka.</p>
<p>The first problem that the wing tackled was the teacher appraisal for our institution. The founding members developed a solution that is in place even today, which we know as OTAS. OTAS is an online teacher appraisal system that allows students to provide feedback about the professors and the institute at the end of every semester. This system helps the management gather unbiased, anonymous feedback from the students. It also helps in the easy interpretation of the feedback and act as seen fit.</p>
<p>The next major project that was taken up is called Ignis. It was developed for The Karnataka State Fire and Emergency Services. It has helped the department to visualize data that was collected over a period of more than fifty years. Highly impressed by the impeccable work delivered by the wing, the Government of Karnataka approached us yet again for another time-intensive agile project that we named ATS, Automated Transfer System. This project helps the government of Karnataka make the personnel transfer process paperless and more organized. They also requested us to reboot Ignis to include more modern methods of data visualization. Due to the confidentiality clauses imposed upon us, we cannot disclose any more details without risking a Government of Karnataka vs Aikya Software Wing faceoff at court.</p>
<p>The Aikya Software Wing developed a system that helps the management keep track of all records related to the on-campus hostel and mess. The system has completely automated all processes from the initial room allocation to the vacation of the room. The wing also developed RoSAT, a system that the institute and the placement cell use to provide the students with opportunities not limited to internships based on your skill set.</p>
<p>Apart from major solutions, the wing also provides the department with websites for events like PROP, INCONTRA, various National and International Conferences and seminars that are conducted by the department.  </p>
<p>Members of the wing have also been asked on multiple occasions to deliver talks on various technologies, the most recent being the Faculty Development Program hosted by the department a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>The wing also has a very active design and content team whose primary focus is creative content. They work with teams outside the wing, such as, the photography team, the newsletter team to design banners, posters, reports and other formal documents for all events and projects that the wing is involved in.</p>
<p>After gaining real world experience by being a part of the wing, members have gone on to pursue their higher education in prestigious universities such as Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, Wisconsin; The University of Texas, Dallas and so on. Few have also gone on to work for major corporations such as Microsoft R&amp;D, Microsoft Seattle, DeltaX, Aurigo, Ola, Subex etc. </p>
